BigO
- Use for comparing two codes
- Time complexity
- Space complexity. Ex- lesser memory
- Omegam beta and omicron
-  O(n) O(n2) O(1) O(log n)
- o(1) most efficient while o(n2) least efficient
- o(n2) - loop within a loop
- o(n) - propotional
- o(log n) - devide and conquer
- o(1) - constant

integers are immutable while dictionaries and mutable.
m = 10
n = m
n = 3 # This will save value 3 in new memory location

m = {'key':3}
n = m
n['key'] = 5 # This updates original m dictionary

Data Structures

1. Linked lists
- linked lists doesn't have indexes
- They are not contiguously stored in memory compared to lists
